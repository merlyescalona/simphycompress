# SimPhy compress dataset

This program allows to compress the number of files and file sizes of a SimPhy run.
Concatenating all loci sequences into a single multiple sequence alignment file for all the different
FASTA outputs (sequences with gaps, or sequences without gaps (`*_TRUE.fasta`)). They are concatenated
with N sequences (as long as desired - `-n/--nsize` parameter). Gene tree files
are shrunked into a sinlge gzipped tab-separated file with 2 columns:

```
filename           tree
```
Where, `filename` is the basename of the gene tree file (e.g. `g_trees00001.tree` -> `g_treees00001`)
and `tree` corresponds to the content of such file.

# Assumptions

- We are working under a [SimPhy](https://github.com/adamallo/simphy) simulation.
Follwing its hierarchical folder structure and sequence labeling.

To know more about the simulation pipeline scenario go to [SimPhy's repository](https://github.com/adamallo/simphy), and/or check:

- Mallo D, de Oliveira Martins L, Posada D (2016) SimPhy: Phylogenomic Simulation of Gene, Locus and Species Trees. *Syst. Biol.* **65**(2) 334-344. doi: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syv082](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syv082)


# Input

- [SimPhy](https://github.com/adamallo/simphy) folder path
- prefix of the existing [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) files
- (optional) length of the N sequence that will be used to separate the sequences when concatenated

# Output

- Modifications are made INPLACE. Meaning, files are concatenated and gzipped in the same SimPhy folder. And so,
the other files are removed.

# Install

- Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:merlyescalona/simphycompress.git
```

- Chance your current directory to the downloaded folder:

```
cd simphycompress
```

- Install:

```
python setup.py install --user
```

# Usage

Required arguments:
- `-s <path>, --simphy-path <path>`: Path of the SimPhy folder.
- `-ip <input_prefix>, --input-prefix <input_prefix>`: Prefix of the FASTA filenames.

Optional arguments:
- `-n <N_seq_size>, --nsize <N_seq_size>`: Number of N's that will be introduced to separate the sequences selected. If the parameter is not set, the output file per replicate will be a multiple alignment sequence file, otherwise, the output will be a single sequence file per replicate consisting of a concatenation of the reference sequences selected separated with as many N's as set for this parameter.
- `-l <log_level>, --log <log_level>`: Specified level of log that will be shown through the standard output. Entire log will be stored in a separate file.
    - Values:['DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR'].
    - Default: 'INFO'.

Information arguments:
  - `-v, --version`: Show program's version number and exit
  - `-h, --help`:    Show this help message and exit
